# YouTube-Mod-Descriptions
Extension to the YouTube Data API. 

Allows a youtube creator to update all of their video descriptions based on a search key. 
This is useful for updating links, social media handles, or any repetitive text that needs to be applied to multiple videos.

Currently, data is hard coded so do not use this on your own videos unless you know what you are doing. I made a quick
fix to update my video descriptions. Soon I will make a nice interface without hard coded variables.
